 ## Observations:

 More than half of the districts have a crime count greater than the average crime count per district. Two of the districts have a count below 500 crimes. District 8 was the only 
 district with over 500,000 crimes.

 There is an overall trend of decreasing crime. However, the years 2018-2019 showed a slight change to this trend, as did 2023.

 The crimes per month is the lowest in July, roughly 530,000, and the highest in July, roughly 720,000. 8 of the 12 months have a crimes per month within 50,000 of the mean crimes per 
 month of 644,110.
